            <br>


            <p class="main_text">
                I am taking computer programming at <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/" target="new">Algonquin College</a> now. 
                I have worked in the accounting field for a long time. However, last year, the pandemic stimulated 
                my interest because it has changed many things. I also felt the accounting area has moved to computerization.
                I am interested in Programming and Database. During this semester, I will focus on two subjects more, 
                and I want to choose one of them for my job.
            </p>

            <p class="main_text">
                As a Co-op student of computer programmer with experience working across the stack of database management
                and web design, I've built projects on small teams, and I'm looking for a role 
                where I can grow and continue to learn from other experienced team members
            </p>
            <br>

            <p class="main_text">
                In my free time, I like to play basketball and golf. Basketball gives me the importance of teamwork 
                as a team player, and golf provides me the time to think about myself and how to control my mind 
                when faced with a crisis.
